# Enhance Your GitHub Profile with Automated Data Insights and Visualizations

## Automatically showcase detailed analytics of your Python repositories via github actions.

### This tool automatically generates insightful data visualizations and key statistics for your repositories, updating your GitHub profile on every push. It seamlessly integrates with your existing profile and appends new information at the bottom so your content stays intact. The graphs that are generated are stitched together in a gif so your profile can remain concise and clean.

Analyze, generate and display visuals for your code in relation to:
- Repositories by commits, line count (of python code)
- A heatmap of your commit activity by day and time
- A word cloud of commit messages
- File type count
- Libraries used (Python)
- Construct counts (count of Loops, classes, control flow statements, async functions etc...)
- Highlights of your most recent closed PRs and commits

Keep your profile engaging with real-time data, without any extra work‚Äîeverything runs automatically through GitHub Actions.

If you want to trigger automated updates instead of manual updates to your Profile.  Go to your github repo where you would like to add auto triggering, add the directory .github/workflows and add a file, trigger.yml. Paste the contents of [this trigger file](https://github.com/sockheadrps/PyProfileDataGen/blob/main/.github/trigger.yml) into it and make a few simple changes listed below.

- Ensure that the ```secrets.TOKEN``` you previously created is added to the repo
    - Refer to [Saving Github API token for the github action](#go-to-your-profile-repo-and-click-on-settings)
- Change ```{owner}``` and ```{repo}``` to that of your profile ```actions.yml``` file
    - Example: ```https://api.github.com/repos/sockheadrps/sockheadrps/actions/workflows/actions.yml/dispatches```
- Change ```{current_repo}``` or the complete message
    - Example: ```"Triggered by One Awesome Repo"```
